Here is an implementation of SDES encryption algorithm using 2 symetric keys to encrypt/decrypt bit code of size <8>. Taking a trip back memory lane as this is the first language (c++) i learned in college. <br/>

To run:



Method 1 (Not using visual studio): <br/>
Clone this repo:

git clone
Locate SDES.cpp file and type into your terminal <br/>
2. g++ SDES.cpp -o {fileoutput-name-this}.exe

Vuala 
3. Type in some string of character you want to encrypt.<br/>

Output/Encrypt 
4. Some encrypted bit code.<br/>

Decrypt 5.<br/>
Decrypt Given the key 1, 2 try decrypting <br/>


Method 2 (using visual studio meh):
