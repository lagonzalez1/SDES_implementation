Here is an implementation of SDES encryption algorithm using 2 symetric keys to encrypt/decrypt bit code of size <8>. Taking a trip back memory lane as this is the first language (c++) i learned in college.

To run:



Method 1 (Not using visual studio): 
Clone this repo:

git clone
Locate SDES.cpp file and type into your terminal 
2. g++ SDES.cpp -o {fileoutput-name-this}.exe

Vuala 
3. Type in some string of character you want to encrypt.

Output/Encrypt 
4. Some encrypted bit code.

Decrypt 5.
Decrypt Given the key 1, 2 try decrypting


Method 2 (using visual studio meh):
