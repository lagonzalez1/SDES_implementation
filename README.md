Here is an implementation of SDES encryption algorithm using 2 symetric keys to encrypt/decrypt bit code of size <8>.
Taking a trip back memory lane as this is the first language (c++) i learned in college. 



To run: 

Clone this repo: 
1. git clone

Locate SDES.cpp file and type into your terminal
2. g++ SDES.cpp -o {fileoutput-name-this}.ext

Vuala
3. Type in some string of character you want to encrypt.

Output/Encrypt
4. Some encrypted bit code.

Decrypt
5. Decrypt
Given the key 1, 2 try decrypting
