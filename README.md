Here is an implementation of SDES encryption algorithm using 2 symetric keys to encrypt/decrypt bit code of size. New to the language c++ so here is my attempt! <br/>

To run:
Compiled on c++ v 14.0.3 <br/>

Method 1 (Not using visual studio): <br/>
Clone this repo:

git clone
Locate SDES.cpp file and type into your terminal <br/>
2. g++ SDES.cpp -o {fileoutput-name-this}.exe
3. execute file on terminal <br/>

./{fileoutput-name-this}.exe

Vuala 
4. Type in some string of character you want to encrypt.<br/>

Output/Encrypt 
5. Some encrypted bit code.<br/>

Decrypt 5.<br/>
Decrypt Given the key 1, 2 try decrypting <br/>
